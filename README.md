# FoodApp User Behavior Analysis Test A/A/B

---

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This repository contains an investigation of user behavior for a foodâ€‘product startupâ€™s mobile/web application. The analysis is divided into two parts:

1. **Funnel Analysis**  
   - Tracks the user journey through key stages (e.g., landing, product view, cart, checkout).  
   - Determines dropâ€‘off rates at each stage and quantifies how many users reach the purchase stage versus those who stall earlier.

2. **A/A/B Font Test**  
   - Compares two control groups (A1 & A2) using the existing font and one test group (B) using a proposed new font.  
   - Verifies consistency between A1 and A2 to assess experiment noise and estimate data requirements for future tests.  
   - Measures conversion rates and engagement metrics to determine whether the new font has a significant impact on user behavior.

All analyses leverage the same dataset, reflecting realâ€‘world practice where experiments run concurrently with ongoing behavioral tracking.
